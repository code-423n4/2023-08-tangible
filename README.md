# Introduction

An APR of +200% paid in stables is a rare and extremely attractive product. These returns, paid to locked token voters, are the backbone of the Solidly model, aka ve(3,3) and what makes it so effective. The downside however is that ve(3,3) economics are dense and complicated, challenging for experienced DeFi users and simply beyond the reach of your basic crypto investor.

CAVIAR, a liquid wrapper from Tangible, removes the complexity and commitment of ve(3,3), creating a simple token for nearly any level of crypto investor. Weekly voting, locking, token management and everything else have been fully automated leaving users with single, simple, high-yield token to stake.

# Caviar Overview

CAVIAR (`$CVR`) is a self-sustaining liquid-wrapper for locked tokens vePEARL, the governance token of the [Pearl Exchange](https://www.pearl.exchange/swap). The main advantage of CAVIAR lies in its streamlined access to outstanding vePEARL yields, paid to voters, and CAVIAR stakers, in the stablecoin `$USDR`. CAVIAR promises to be a substantial source of income for both the CAVIAR users as well as Tangible 3,3+ locked token holders, who will receive 20% of the vePEARL yield.

## Glossary 
- **$PEARL:** ERC-20 governance token/emission token for Pearl Exchange, an AMM on Polygon
- **&#36;vePEARL:** ERC-721 tokens (NFTs) containing &#36;PEARL that’s been locked up to 2 years to obtain voting rights on Pearl Exchange
- **$CVR:** CAVIAR, the liquid-wrapper created by Tangible
- **Epoch:** A period lasting 7 days, restarting every Thursday at 00:00 GMT
- **Rebase:** A process on Pearl where up to 50% of weekly emissions are allocated to &#36;vePEARL holders and directly added to their &#36;vePEARL positions
- **Bribes:** Money deposited in Pearl to entice voters to pick different liquidity pools to receive yield in the form of $PEARL emissions
- **Stake:** Staking is the process of submitting your CAVIAR into a contract where it can collect bribes. CAVIAR must be staked on Tangible to receive any benefits.
- **TNGBL 3,3+:** Locked Tangible/$TNGBL the governance token of the Tangible protocol
- **$CVR_balance:** The balance of CAVIAR in the Pearl stable LP
- **$CVR_staked:** The total CAVIAR in the staking contract 
- **&#36;PEAL_balance:** The balance of &#36;PEARL in the Pearl stable LP
- **$CVR_total:** The total minted supply of CAVIAR

## CAVIAR Explained - How to Use, Redeem and Profit

![caviar-explained](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-423n4/2023-08-tangible/main/caviar-explained.png )

Earning triple-digit stablecoin yield has never been easier, it just takes three simple steps:

1. Get CAVIAR: Buy CAVIAR on Pearl or mint it yourself on Tangible, depositing PEARL or vePEARL into our vault.

2. Stake: Stake CAVIAR on Tangible to start earning the highest possible daily yield.

3. Claim: Claim yield any time. Rewards accrue by block and are delivered to your wallet as USDR.

## Minting or Buying CAVIAR
- **Mint PEARL → CAVIAR:** Users can mint CAVIAR with $PEARL 1:1 at any time on Tangible, no fees or any additional costs other than gas on Polygon.
- **Mint vePEARL → CAVIAR:** Users can min CAVIAR on Tangible with their vePEARL NFT. Minting with vePEARL incurs a dynamic conversion fee influenced by the CAVIAR - PEARL balance in the stable LP on Pearl Exchange.
- **Buy CAVIAR:** Users can go to Pearl Exchange to swap any token supported on the exchange for CAVIAR, only paying the standard fees associated with a normal swap plus gas.

## Redeeming or Selling CAVIAR
- **Redeem CAVIAR → vePEARL:** At any point in time, users can redeem CAVIAR for vePEARL on Tangible, incurring a 3.5% conversion fee plus gas.
- **Sell CAVIAR:** Users can swap CAVIAR for any token supported on Pearl Exchange, only paying the standard fees associated with a normal swap plus gas.

## Claim CAVIAR Revenue
Unlock the power of triple-digit vePEARL APRs with CAVIAR. Simply stake CAVIAR on Tangible to begin earning yield, which is distributed by block and claimable immediately. All yield is distributed back to users in [USDR](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/why-is-real-usd-better-money), Tangible’s native yield stablecoin backed by tokenized real estate.

Using the vePEARL voting power backing CAVIAR and a vote optimizer, we’re able to return the high auto-converting fees, bribes, and rebases into CAVIAR, our innovative distribution system allocates a staggering 81.5% of the voting rewards to the single staking pool, ensuring higher rewards for stakers.

### Bribe Fee

20% of bribes will be converted into USDC and sent to TNGB 3,3+ holders.

### Tangible Marketing Fee

50% of rebase will be sent to Tangible or affiliate marketing partners as an integrated source of funds to support CVR marketing operations.

### Dynamic Conversion Fee

When converting vePEARL to CAVIAR, a dynamic conversion fee is applied. The fee is influenced by the balance of the stable LP on Pearl and ranges from a minimum of 12.5% to a maximum of 70%. The dynamic conversion fee formula is:
`Dynamic fee = ($CVR_balance / $PEARL_balance) * min_conversion_fee`

**Example:**

If the balance in the CAVIAR/PEARL LP is 1000 &#36;PEARL and 2000 &#36;CVR, the conversion fee would be:
`Conversion fee = (2000 / 1000) * 12.5% = 2 * 12.5% = 25%`

## Distribution Formulas
To understand the CAVIAR advantage, let's break down the distribution formulas for the LPs and staking pool.

1. Calculate `CVR_total:`
   
`CVR_total = CVR_Balance + CVR_staked`

2. Calculate `LPs Distribution:`
   
`LPs Distribution = (CVR_LP_balance / CVR_total) * (Rebase/2)`

3. Calculate `Staking Distribution:`

`Staking Distribution = (Rebase/2) - LPs Distribution`

**Example:**

Assuming `CVR_LP_balance` is 500, `CVR_staked` is 400, and `Rebase` is 100:

`CVR_total = 500 + 400 = 900 LPs Distribution = (500 / 900) * (100/2) = 27.78`

`Staking Distribution = (100/2) - 27.78 = 22.22`

## Bootstrapping CAVIAR: Low-Fee Promotional Window

For a limited time, users can convert vePEARL into CAVIAR for a static 5% fee, capped at 4,000,000 vePEARL.
